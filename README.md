# Maze-Solver-Genetic-Algorithm

Description: This repository contains a genetic algorithm approach to solving mazes. Algorithm contains certain amount of bots in its population, which DNAs contain a sequence of moves. As the rules say, best bots are then mixed although best bots stay in population in order to prevent losing best sequences.
